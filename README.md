Cleaned Cafe Sales Dataset

# Data Cleaning Practice  

This repository contains my practice work on data cleaning and preparation using Excel. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and serves as a hands-on project to explore different cleaning techniques, transformations, and basic analysis.  
 
# The goal of this project is to:  
- Practice identifying and handling messy data  
- Explore different Excel functions and features for cleaning  
- Build simple summaries and visualizations
 

# Data Cleaning and Analysis used:
- XLOOKUP: find and match values across the table.
- IFERROR: handle error based on condition.
- Find and Replace: standardize repeated text entries.
- Cell Formatting: standardize text and number format and cell alignment.
- Conditional Formatting: checked if there are duplicate transactions.
- Navigation: created a navigation tab to easily switch worksheets.
- Pivot Table: generated pivot table to summarize basic sales analysis.
- Charts: generated charts for visualization of sales for easier analysis.
