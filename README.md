Cleaned Cafe Sales Dataset

# Data Cleaning Practice  

This repository contains my practice work on data cleaning and preparation using Excel. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and serves as a hands-on project to explore different cleaning techniques, transformations, and basic analysis.  
 
# The goal of this project is to:  
- Practice identifying and handling messy data  
- Explore different Excel functions and features for cleaning  
- Build simple summaries and visualizations
 

# Data Cleaning and Analysis used:
- XLOOKUP: find and match values across the table.
- IFERROR: handle error based on condition.
- Find and Replace: standardize repeated text entries.
- Cell Formatting: standardize text and number format and cell alignment.
- Conditional Formatting: checked if there are duplicate transactions.
- Navigation: created a navigation tab to easily switch worksheets.
- Pivot Table: generated pivot table to summarize basic sales analysis.
- Charts: generated charts for visualization of sales for easier analysis.

# Conclusion: 
The workbook provides a clearer view for analysis of the Cafe Sales in the year 2023, the total sales within the year is easily seen. However, it is apparent that there are "unknown" values in the Item, Location, Payment Method and Transaction date fields, and since the dataset was outsourced, it was transformed based only on the given data. With these inconsistencies, the whole data should be interpreted with caution and should be attended for a much realiable analysis in the future. Nonetheless, it can be said that the Total Sales are fully captured and the goal of the project was reached.
